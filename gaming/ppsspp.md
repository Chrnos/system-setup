This is an absolutely awesome PSP emulator with zero post-install configuration.

To be completely honest, it has the best UI/UX out of any modern software I have used on the desktop.  The controls are seemless and premapped intelligently, work with keyboard and controller, and is fully custom using opengl.


# installation

I recommend building it from the [latest source](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp).  If you need it to be entirely stable, you can checkout the appropriately tagged release.
