Steam is an amalgam of a multi-game client and a platform-agnostic game distributor.

I absolutely love it, but because of it's DRM components and licensing (which are what **allow** us to have non-free games) it isn't exactly 100% linux friendly, and the default package in debian literally cannot be automatically installed due to a nasty agreement.

The [downloadable package](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steam.deb) on the otherhand, will display the agreement on first-execution instead.


## bugs

The client is not without bugs.  I experienced dozens of segfaults because of some missing component from my nvidia driver installation, and it was in no way indicative of a failed nvidia driver install (my video worked just fine).
