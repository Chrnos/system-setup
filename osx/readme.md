# OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) ReadMe

I use a Macbook Pro as my primary development machine, and it is my laptop of choice.

I setup the system to be a clean workspace, so I don't generally setup gaming or multimedia utilities except to test for projects.

Many of the instructions provided here will be greatly enhanced by using the [dot-files](/cdelorme/dot-files/) I have built.


## Breif Rant

I love linux, however I loath laptop manufacturers, and this loathing grows with every year.

I use a Macbook because it is the only worthwhile peice of "Hardware" on the market.  I could care less about pure aesthetics.  What I want is a functional and durable system, which means it should last me a long time and work well during the length of ownership.

Everything on the market was crap, built with giant bulky plastic, noisy fans that provided inadequate cooling, a power connector that was giant and two-peices, and shorted or broke off at the end due to there obvious poor design.  Further still, if I loaded any of these with linux the hardware was often custom for that specific model and drivers either didn't exist or worked poorly.

I switched to an Apple six years ago, after having used windows for most of my life.  It was the first time I experienced a decently reliable machine that did exactly as advertised in over a decade of failure.  During that decade I had terrible one to three year experiences with these brands:

- Dell
- HP
- Compaq
- Acer
- KDS (worst decision ever)

While I have recommended `Asus` and `Lenovo` to friends and family as "budget" machines, I have never owned either.  Those who listened to my recommendations had similar experiences to my own, where within three years the machine would grow slow and die (not only due to running windows, but certainly related).

The **very** recent advent of "Ultrabooks" finally seemed to begin addressing the clunky design and poor construction I had been upset with for years.  **Except they cost as much or more than a Mac with none of the history to stand behind their products.**

Over the years I have used OS X I have also grown quite accustomed to a multi-touch mouse, which none of the competation has even come close to reproducing.  Further, multiple screens is something Windows has lacked and greatly needs.  Nothing improves productivity like being able to organize applications into separate monitor spaces.  Linux has this but laptops are still being produced with anti-linux hardware, so that also needs to be addressed.

In conclusion the other options on the market all involve a serious hit to my wallet, productivity, and peace of mind.  Until manufacturers get their act together a recognize these problems I am stuck buying apple laptops.
