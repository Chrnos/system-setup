# OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) Documentation

This document accounts for most steps I usually take to setup a system that is well configured and ready for development.


## Installation

**Avoid case sensative file systems, as this breaks numerous software, such as the entire Adobe suite.**

Do not setup drive encryption (eg. `File Vault`) during installation, instead wait intil you have installed and updated the system before encrypting the contents.  Otherwise you may have to reverse the encryption to account for updates to the system and re-encrypt the whole thing again after updating.

The first step after installing should then be checking for updates.


## Dot Files

**Next I recommend using my [dot-files repository](/cdelorme/dot-files/) to enhance your prompt, vim configuration, and set a bunch of useful configuration defaults.**

Creating a set of useful dot-files is essential to enhancing your command line situation, but not everyone will find all of my settings to be useful.


## Mythical Root User

The root user exists on osx, and its home dir is `/var/root`.  By default the root account on OSX uses the `/bin/sh` shell, which I would recommend switching to bash.

You can also install the same [dot-files](/cdelorme/dot-files/) repository as root.


##### Commands

_To set the root users shell:_

    sudo su
    chsh -s /bin/bash root


## System Settings & Configuration

These are the changes I make to my `System Preferences`, and are listed by the main section, then each sub-option:

- Dock
    - Smaller Size
    - Slight Maginification
    - Align Right
    - Scale effect
    - All checkboxes

- Mission Control
    - Remove Show Dashboard from F12
    - Hot Corners
        - Application Windows Top Left
        - Desktop Top Right

_I generally add a second desktop by default to start with._

- Displays
    - Do not automatically adjust brightness

- Energy Saver
    - Battery Display Sleep after 10 Minutes

- Keyboard
    - Keyboard
        - Turn off key backlighting after 10 seconds of inactivity
    - Keyboard Shortcuts

            - Add/Enable Select next source in input menu (cmd+alt+space)
        - Spotlight
            - Disable show spotlight window hotkey
        - Accessibility
            - Disable Voiceover Toggle
            - Disable Show Accessibility Controls
        - Bottom Setting "All Controls" not just inputs

    - Tracking Speed Faster than default
    - More Gestures
        - App Expose
        - Turn off Launchpad

    - Tink (Alert Sound)
    - Reduced Alert Volume
    - Do not play feedback when volume is changed

- Bluetooth Off (Conserves battery)

- Time Machine
    - Do not show menu bar icon

- Privacy & Security
    - Require Password 1 Minute after Display Sleep
    - File Vault
        - Enable User Access to Encrypted Disk
    - Turn Firewall On
        - Stealth Mode
    - Advanced:
        - Disable Remote Receiver

**Retina models no-longer have an Infrared Sensor and can omit sensor settings.**

_Since I will occassionally type japanese on my system I add the following input source:_

- Language & Text
    - Input Sources
        - Check Kotoeri


## Custom Fonts

- [ForMateKonaVe](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hetima/20061102/1162435711)
- [EPSON Kyoukashoutai](http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Japanese.html)

The EPSON font has been uploaded with skewed ASCII conversion, so while the font will work, its name is nearly impossible to type.  I recommend running it through a font editor simply to adjust the name to something sensible.

_The links for these fonts are externally hosted and may no-longer be valid.  A copy of these will be included in a later copy of this repository._

Installing fonts can be done by opening them and clicking the install button, or you can install them locally into `~/Library/Fonts/`, or globally `/Library/Fonts`.


## Disable Dashboard

I think the dashboard sucks, but if you use it you are welcome to skip this step.  I have never found it to be useful; Applications load fast enough off SSD's that having an always-open micro-application is not nearly as useful as it may have been several years ago.


##### Commands

_To stop the dashboard from starting by default:_

    defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES
    killall Dock


## Finder Settings

Open the finder settings menu with command + j.

I generally check the box to force `List View` as the default.

I also check the calculate size option, because it makes checking folder and file sizes fast and easy.


##### Commands

_Run this to remove saved view settings and reload finder:_

    sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;
    killall Finder


## Change Terminal Settings

I generally install and use [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home), but I also configure the default terminal just in case I need to use it.

I set the default color scheme to `Homebrew`, transparency to 40% with a 5% blur.


## Unhide `~/Library`

Recently OS X made this folder invisible, for whatever reason, and that can make accessible stuff difficult.


##### Commands

_To fix the hidden `~/Library`, run this:_

    chflags nohidden ~/Library


## Install Java

OS X does not install Java by default, so if you want to run Java applications you will need to install it.  The [64bit JDK7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) is now available, but you can also install JDK6 using `java --version` from a terminal.


## Program Installation & Configuration

From the App store I can grab these applications:

- [Dash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12)
- [Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12)
- [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

_Dash is a pay-to-use application, but it is an exceptionally useful tool that gives you instant access to documentation for almost any language you can program in._

If you only need XCode command line tools you can now download and install them independently by logging into the [developer downloads](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#) with your apple ID.  But if you want to use XCode you may as well grab it from the app store, and it is free again (_it wasn't when OS X Lion released_).

Next I gather and install the following applications:

- [Google Chrome Dev Channel](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel)
- [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)
- [Firefox Aurora](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/)
- [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/)
- [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) OR [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/)
- [MacTubes](http://macapps.sakura.ne.jp/mactubes/index_en.html)
- [xQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)
- [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/)
- [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Dia)

_You will need xQuartz installed to setup Dia and Inkscape._

Omnigraffle is hands down the best diagramming software I have ever used, but it is not free and it is moderately pricey as far as OS X software goes.  Also, it is not an open-source technology, so it is not compatible with other diagramming software.

Transmit is a paid for FTP application that comes with drive mounting, making it very easy to manage files over a network without using SSH and command line.

The following list may include registration keys, add them now or when we configure them:

- Omnigraffle
- Sublime Text 2/3
- Transmit

**I no longer use Parallels Desktop, there latest release continues to fail to provide adequate linux virtual machine support, whereas VirtualBox is only getting better with every update.**

Sublime Text 2 is the stable release, but may be slower than the new beta.


## Configuring Installed Software

### XCode

If you downloaded XCode and not just the command line tools, you will need to install the command line tools from XCode.

Open it up, go to the settings, and select the downloads tab.

In the list select `Install XCode Command Line Tools`.


### Dash

Open the settings:

- Validate your purchased copy by selecting Purchase then `Restore` at the bottom
- Use HUD mode and specify a prefered hotkey (I use alt + space)

Here is a list of documentation I generally select (there are tons more):

- C
- C++
- CSS
- GLib
- Go
- HTML
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Java SE7
- Java SE6
- Node.js
- OpenGL 2
- MySQL
- OpenGL 4
- Perl
- PHP
- Python 2
- Python 3

Depending on the projects I am actively working on I may disable some of the downloaded languages to reduce search results.


### The Unarchiver

Modify settings:

- Always Extract to same folder
- Affiliation with all files (except iso's etc)
- Delete compressed file after extraction


### iTerm 2

Settings:

- Size 14 Font
- ForMateKonaVE Font Family

Import the [`Solarized High Contrast Dark`](https://github.com/mariozaizar/dotfiles/blob/master/themes/iTerm2/Solarized%20High%20Contrast%20Dark.itermcolors) color scheme from the GUI.

_Color schemes in iterm are loaded into a plist file and so doing so from command line is not as easy.  Someday I will document how to, if I ever figure it out myself._


### VirtualBox

VirtualBox offers USB 2.0 support, but you have to download and install the [Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

I also recommend creating a Host-Only network with a predictable IP range (I generally use 10.0.5.1).

_Unlike Parallels Desktop and VMware, VBox networking is a bit more complex.  They do not offer a simple "Internal network address with internet and open ports", because they firewall their NAT.  So you have to assign a NAT adapter, and a Host-Only adapter if you want to be able to predictably access the device and not setup a bunch of port forwards._


## [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

OS X is running UNIX, but it does not come with a package manager by default.  As such two have been created.  There is [macports](http://www.macports.org/) if you would rpefer, but I use homebrew.  You can use both if you want to get software that each provides.  I prefer the homebrew `no-password` phylosophy towards installing user-local software.

**Homebrew does depend on Command Line Tools, which depends on xCode, so these must be installed before you can use Homebrew.**

Here is my comprehensive list of recommended homebrew packages:

- vim
- bash-completion
- tmux
- mercurial
- git
- git-flow
- weechat
- wget
- sshfs
- osxfuse
- fuse4x
- xz
- libgcrypt
- jpeg
- jpeg9
- jpeg-turbo
- libpng
- libtiff
- gd
- imagemagick
- graphicsmagick
- intltool
- gettext
- swftools
- nodejs
- tidy
- go
- josegonzalez/php/phplint
- apple-gcc42
- cppcheck
- cmake
- autoconf
- automake
- d-bus
- glib
- gmp
- gnutls
- gobject-introspection
- pkg-config
- gtk+3
- python
- python3
- pygobject3
- py2gobject3
- wine
- winetricks

_I did what I could to group related items by purpose or language, but this is a comprehensive list of all the tools I use.  Many of these have dependencies, and you may be asked to install those separately._


##### Commands

_Run these commands to install homebrew and all of my packages:_

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
    brew doctor
    brew install vim
    brew install bash-completion
    brew install tmux
    brew install mercurial
    brew install git
    brew install git-flow
    brew install weechat
    brew install wget
    brew install sshfs
    brew install osxfuse
    brew install fuse4x
    brew install xz
    brew install libgcrypt
    brew install jpeg
    brew install jpeg9
    brew install jpeg-turbo
    brew install libpng
    brew install libtiff
    brew install gd
    brew install imagemagick
    brew install graphicsmagick
    brew install intltool
    brew install gettext
    brew install swftools
    brew install nodejs
    brew install --HEAD tidy
    brew install go
    brew install josegonzalez/php/phplint
    brew install apple-gcc42
    brew install cppcheck
    brew install cmake
    brew install autoconf
    brew install automake
    brew install d-bus
    brew install glib
    brew install gmp
    brew install gnutls
    brew install gobject-introspection
    brew install pkg-config
    brew install gtk+3
    brew install python
    brew install python3
    brew install pygobject3
    brew install py2gobject3
    brew install wine
    brew install winetricks


### Installing `pip`

The python package manager should be installed if you intend to use python (and you probably will without realizing it).

If you develop in python you will want `pip` to add the `pep8` package for syntax support.  For interactive python debugging you should also install [bpython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bpython).


##### Commands

_Run these to install pip, pep8, and bpython:_

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo easy_install pip3
    pip install pep8
    pip-3.3 install pep8
    pip-3.3 install bpython

_You can omit the 3.3 and use just pip if you program in the 2.x version of python._


### nodejs Globals

For nodejs development, I recommend installing some tools globally.  Here is my recommended list:

- csslint
- jshint
- csso
- yo


##### Commands

_To install nodejs globals:_

    npm install -g csslint
    npm install -g jshint
    npm install -g csso
    npm install -g yo


### Path Modifications

Many of the packages you install with homebrew will already exist on the machine.  To use the new version you have to change the `PATH` global variable to include the local bin first.  Be sure to add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

_This is one of the many modifications that is handled by my dot-files automatically._


### SSH Key Generation

It is recommended that you generate an ssh key, which can be used for ssh tunneling, numerous encryption services, and version control software.

##### Commands

_Run this and follow the defaults, optionally filling in the blank with your email:_

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<youremail>"


### Git Configuration

I usually set a number of defaults in my `~/.gitconfig`:

- username
- email
- editor
- auto-correction
- color ui
- push auto-match branch
- several aliases

The `~/.githelpers` file was written by [Gary Bernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/.githelpers), and is also included with my dot-files repo.

I generally create a `~/git/` folder to store my projects.

I highly recommend [Ralph Bean's Awesome Git Flow Tutorial](http://threebean.org/presentations/gitflow/#/step-1) and the [Git Bash Completion](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) script (included with my `dot-files`).


##### Commands

_Run these and optionally fill in the blanks:_

    git config --global user.name "<yourname>"
    git config --global user.email "<youremail>"
    git config --global core.editor "vim"
    git config --global help.autocorrect 1
    git config --global color.ui true
    git config --global push.default matching
    git config --global alias.a add
    git config --global alias.s 'status --untracked-files=all'
    git config --global alias.c commit
    git config --global alias.st stash
    git config --global alias.sa 'stash apply'
    git config --global alias.l '!. ~/.githelpers && pretty_git_log'
    git config --global alias.l '!git pull && git push'


### Activate bash-completion

Even after installing it with homebrew, you may have to add a symlink for it to be loaded.  Additionally you may need to load it from command line by running that symlink.


##### Commands

_Run this to create the symlink:_

    ln -s "/usr/local/Library/Contributions/brew_bash_completion.sh" "/usr/local/etc/bash_completion"

_Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:_

    if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
      . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
    fi

_This is another configuration that I include in my dot-files repository._


### Sublime Text 2

Some of the steps here are dependent on other configurations, thus why it is last on this list, but it does not have to be.

If you have a license you should register your copy.

To make it accessible by terminal you can create a symbolic link:

    sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/bin/subl

Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2):

    import urllib2,os,hashlib; h = '7183a2d3e96f11eeadd761d777e62404e330c659d4bb41d3bdf022e94cab3cd0'; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs( ipp ) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener( urllib2.build_opener( urllib2.ProxyHandler()) ); by = urllib2.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/' + pf.replace(' ', '%20')).read(); dh = hashlib.sha256(by).hexdigest(); open( os.path.join( ipp, pf), 'wb' ).write(by) if dh == h else None; print('Error validating download (got %s instead of %s), please try manual install' % (dh, h) if dh != h else 'Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation')


### Sublime Text 3

Sublime Text 3 is still in beta, and while it will accept your Sublime Text 2 registration key to silence its nag-messages, it specifically states that Sublime Text 3 will be a paid upgrade (eg. when it launched you will get nagged again or have to make a new purchase/upgrade).

In the same fashion as Sublime Text 2 you can add a symlink to launch it from command line:

    sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/bin/subl

Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st3):

    import urllib.request,os,hashlib; h = '7183a2d3e96f11eeadd761d777e62404e330c659d4bb41d3bdf022e94cab3cd0'; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); urllib.request.install_opener( urllib.request.build_opener( urllib.request.ProxyHandler()) ); by = urllib.request.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/' + pf.replace(' ', '%20')).read(); dh = hashlib.sha256(by).hexdigest(); print('Error validating download (got %s instead of %s), please try manual install' % (dh, h)) if dh != h else open(os.path.join( ipp, pf), 'wb' ).write(by)


### Sublime Text Packages

These settings will work in both versions of sublime text for your user settings, and I recommend them:

    {
        "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
        "caret_style": "phase",
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Sunburst.tmTheme",
        "font_face": "ForMateKonaVe",
        "font_size": 16.0,
        "highlight_line": true,
        "highlight_modified_tabs": true,
        "match_brackets_angle": true,
        "scroll_past_end": true,
        "scroll_speed": 2.0,
        "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
        "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true
    }

The following packages and package configuration are mostly compatible with both versions 2 and 3 of Sublime Text.

Install these plugins:

- [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview)
- [SublimeCodeIntel](https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel)
- [Origami](https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami)
- [Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime)
- [Encoding Helper](https://github.com/SublimeText/EncodingHelper)
- [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)
- [SublimeLinter-json](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-json)
- [SublimeLinter-pep8](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-pep8)
- [SublimeLinter-phplint](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-phplint)
- [SublimeLinter-html-tidy](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-html-tidy)
- [SublimeLinter-jshint](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-jshint)

These packages depend on a mixture of homebrew, pip, and nodejs components, all of which are in the instructions you've already read.  Be sure to read each documentation if it is not working for you.

I find that `Emmet` confuses me with its code completion for css, so I disable css completion in my emmet user config, but whether you do the same is up to your preferences:

    {
        "disable_tab_abbreviations_for_scopes": "source.css",
    }

Next, in order to make sure we have the correct paths for some of our linters, we want to force the system to recognize `/usr/local/bin` first by adding this to the SublimeLinter user config:

    "paths": {
        "linux": [],
        "osx": [
            "/usr/local/bin"
        ],
        "windows": []
    },

_This will fix things like which tidy is being used, since OS X comes with tidy for html4._

I also recommend these keyboard bindings (Preferences > Keyboard Bindings (User)):

    [
        { "keys": ["ctrl+enter"], "command": "goto_python_definition"},
        { "keys": ["ctrl+tab"], "command": "next_view" },
        { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+tab"], "command": "prev_view" },
        { "keys": ["alt+m"], "command": "markdown_preview", "args":
            { "target": "browser", "parser": "markdown" }
        },
        { "keys": ["super+shift+r"], "command": "reindent" , "args": { "single_line": false } },
        { "keys": ["super+b"], "command": "markdown_preview",
            "args": { "target": "browser", "parser": "markdown" },
            "context": [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "text.html.markdown" }]
        }
    ]

Note that these same options can be added to a linux or windows configuration, but you will want to swap `super` for `ctrl`.  The `super+b` hotkey is for markdown files and overrides the default build process which only builds the html file.

Worth checking out the [SublimeText Crypto Package](https://github.com/mediaupstream/SublimeText-Crypto) if you like the idea of encrypting your notes, it's pretty sweet.


## Markdown Quicklook

I install this so I can easily preview markdown files, the [repository is here](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown), but you can [download a prebuilt file here](http://jamesmoss.co.uk/blog/support-for-markdown-in-osx-quicklook/) and toss them into `/Library/QuickLook`.

With this package you can use the space-bar like with images and pdf files, and it will display HTML rendered preview of a markdown file.


## Reorganize Dock

Now that we have all the software we want installed, we can proceed to organize our dock to have just the tools we need.  Here is what my dock looks like:

- Finder
- iTerm2
- Sublime Text 2/3
- xCode
- Transmit
- mnigraffle
- Dia
- Inkscape
- Chrome
- Safari
- Aurora
- Firefox
- Opera
- Parallels Desktop
- iTunes
- FaceTime
- Photobooth
- iPhoto
- iCal
- App Store
- System Preferences

I make sure to remove anything not in that list, so I don't have to look for the tools I want to use.

_Despite the way the Dock is organize, I use it primarily for drag-and-drop, because anytime I want to open an application I use spotlight with command + space._


## Sync Accounts

You can optionally open your system preferences and sync the `Mail, Contacts & Calendars` to your gmail account.

I also sync my google chrome to my gmail account.


## File Vault

The last step is encrypting the drive.  With everything installed and configured we can do so by going to "System Preferences" > "Security", then the "File Vault" tab.

This wraps the drive contents in a password protected layer, and the process can take a couple of hours, but you should still be able to use your system while it is processing.

This is ideal for laptops where the hard drive can be removed and accessed elsewhere, but with modern MPB models where the drive is soldered to the board it may not be nearly as useful.  It can also slow down the access speeds, so whether you need this feature is up to you.


## Conclusion

Thus concludes my OS X setup process.  If you have configured your machine in the same way it will be ready for most development projects.

Note that despite how many tools I install on the system, I prefer and often use virtualization to offload a majority of testing to keep the main system running light and smooth.  Many services like a database or web server would consume resource when running and add to the number of things my main system is then responsible for.

For that reason I recommend visiting my linux guides and setting up a virtual machine for web development or any code that can be offloaded and is not needed on your host.
