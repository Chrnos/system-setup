# OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) ReadMe

I use a Macbook Pro as my primary development machine, and it is my laptop of choice.

I setup the system to be a clean workspace, so I don't generally setup gaming or multimedia utilities except to test for projects.


## Breif Rant

I love Linux, I really do.  However, I absolutely loath laptop manufacturers, and have felt this way for over a decade.  I use a Macbook Pro (MBP) because it is the most reliable option as a work machine.

I switched to an Apple only six years ago, after working on Windows computers for most of my life.  Prior to this I had used machines from many manufacturers which seemed to die or literally fall apart over the span of a year.  Brands such as:

- Dell
- HP
- Compaq
- Acer
- KDS (worst decision ever)

I have recommended other brands to friends and family:

- Asus
- Lenovo

However, I have never once had a good experience with any of the above brands.  I have also found that my friends and family try to keep these machines for over 3 years and things get extra slow.  I get called in as the family repairman, and I hate it.

Until the **very** recent advent of "Ultrabook" my biggest complaint, besides Windows, was probably the clunky design.  Everything was built using enormous chunks of soft plastic.  It looked, felt, and was cheap garbage filled with sub-par hardware.

I could care less about aesthetics alone, but I am very concerned about a sturdy functional design.  This is something I have not seen in a laptop manufacturer besides Apple until "Ultrabooks" hit the market.

These new machines labeled "Ultrabooks" hit the market, and now there is finally some competition.  Except the competition is still releasing with Windows, commonly has hardware that may not be compatible with Linux, and while it is finally using quality parts the cost is equal to a MBP but with zero history to backup its hardware reliability.

Having used OS X for six years I have also grown quite accustomed to the system, and recognized several components that have a significant effect on my productivity that would prevent me from even wanting to go to another machine.

First, while I was never a heavy mouse user, OS X uses gestures just like hotkeys for the GUI.  I commonly have dozens of windows open, so this has been a huge improvement in my workflow.  I cannot fathom going back to alt+tab in windows, which is where they still are.  Linux may have solutions for this with the keyboard, but it probably varies by which of the myriad of GUI's you pick from.

Second, multiple screens which OS X and Linux both have, but OS X makes them super easy to use (again with gestures).  Windows still does not have this, and that drives me crazy.  It helps me coordinate or organize my windows so I can feel less cluttered when I only have one physical monitor to work from.

In conclusion, at this stage switching would involve a serious hit to my productivity.  I would either be fighting windows, or constantly tweaking a Linux box, so until manufacturers get that act together and offer a significant improvement in hardware and price then I will stick with my MBP.
