# snapshots

Most virtualization software allows you to create snapshots, and often clones are based on snapshot states.

These are an **excellent** way to reset to a state prior to corruption, viruses, and other issues, as they are a snapshot of disk state above the OS itself, which makes them much safer.


## compression and disk space

Keep in mind that usually you cannot compress disks, or at least not as cleanly, when you use snapshots.  This can dramatically increase the size consumed by systems.
