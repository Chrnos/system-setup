# Puppet

[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) is an automated provisioning system, and in fact is probably prefered to shell scripted automations.

The intented goal is to make a unified system for installing services and configuring tools, which varies by distro and platform.  While it is a great tool and I use it in other projects, I chose bash for my configuration as puppet must be installed to be used.  With bash scripts I can copy via usb, or grab from the net using `git clone`, `curl`, or `wget` and simply run the script.
