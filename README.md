# System Setup

I use virtualization extensively, and one problem I encounter regularly is rebuilding the systems.

To counteract this I have created comprehensive documentation, and to go a step further I intend to create setup scripts as well.

I have created this repository to store my documentation and scripts for all machines to ease the reconfiguration process.  Many of the steps covered in my document are not covered anywhere else on the web.  Also the instructions and scripts are "made-to-order", and are probably not fit for general-purpose scenarios.


### Warning

For obvious reasons anything that may damage the security of my systems will be omitted from my documentation and scripts and may require replacement for the scripts to function properly.  Sections of each README will be added to cover these missing components.


## Organizational Structure

The contents herein will be organized by Operating System, Version, and finally a custom name according to its overall purpose.  The names are intended to be short and generic and do not vividly reflect all the details.

An accompanying README file will be included with each that summarizes the systems intended use.  You can expect each folder to contain documentation, and where able one or more scripts for automated setup.  The scripts will be lightly commented, the documentation will thoroughly explain all the steps.


## Future Plans

I have two key objectives to meet before this project is truly "completed".

1. Fully automate the scripts execution, including resume-on-reboot.

2. Investigate the creation of a Custom Debian Installer ISO to automate the entire process from the beginning of the installation.
