# System Setup

I use virtualization extensively, and decided it would be cool go a step beyond simply documenting the setup process of my systems, and create setup scripts.

Further it would be nice if I could easily access this documentation or these scripts from anywhere to expedite the setup process of any machine I may use.

I have also found that many of the steps I perform are not documented elsewhere on the internet, and wanted to share my documentation with others so they may pick and choose components they find useful.


### Warning

For obvious reasons anything that may be a security risk, such as passwords, usernames, and port numbers will either be removed or replaced with generic placeholders.  This means you should read through and modify the scripts before executing them if you happen to be downloading them.


## Organizational Structure

The contents are organized by Operation System, Version, and finally System Name.

I named each system using minimalist but descriptive terms based on the purpose of the system.

Each folder may contain:

- A Readme
- Documentation
- Setup Script(s)

The accompanying readme will provide the purpose of the system, and details regarding the execution of related setup scripts.

The documentation will be a detailed and thorough summary of the setup scripts, or instructions that perhaps cannot be easily automated (such as for OS X and Windows).


## Future Plans

I have two final objectives with these scripted systems.

1. Fully automate the scripts execution, including resume-on-reboot.

2. Investigate the creation of a Custom Debian Installer ISO to automate the entire process from the beginning of the installation.
