This document will contain the configuration of, and suggested packages for, Sublime Text.

It will be written for the current latest version.

Sublime Text is an absolutely fantastic text editor with plugins that support nearly everything an IDE can do.  It loads lightning fast, and renders identically cross platform.  It's the first editor I've found that has aliased non-pixelated text on Windows.  It is nagware so if you want to avoid an occasional popup then buy it, it is well worth the cost.  Worth noting, the Sublime Text 2 keys work for Sublime Text 3 while it is in beta, and also Sublime Text 3 encrypts the keys now so you cannot simply copy them to the install folder.
