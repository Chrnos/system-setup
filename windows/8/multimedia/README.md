# Windows 8 Multimedia ReadMe

I use this system on a Xen server.

It is primarily a multimedia computer setup for watching movies and playing video games.


---

This setup was intended to run on Xen with VGA Passthrough.  VGA Passthrough is not entirely stable with consumer cards, and as a result the setup process has been broken up into sections.

- A section prior to driver installation.
- System backup occurs here.
- Driver installation including GPLPV (xen specific drivers).
- Post driver software installation.

**This means many of the steps I document are precautionary to prevent BSoD problems within the virtual environment.**

If you too are setting up VGA Passthrough, be sure to follow the documentation closely.
