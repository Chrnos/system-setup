# System Setup
#### Updated 2013-11-20

I use virtualization extensively.  For me it solves most of my computer woes while granting me greater flexibility both long and short term.  Learning how to use virtual machines has also dramatically improved my linux `foo`.

However, it is not without its own set of problems.  I have reinstalled systems hundreds of times, and often use the same configurations.  I am picky about minimalist configuration, so this repository is to help document & expedite my installations via automation, while retaining the level of control I desire in those configurations.


## Instructions

I am a debian guy, it is what I know best, so while I may slowly add other platforms, most things will likely be done and documented in debian first.

Ideally the documentation chains from one configuration to the next, and so in most cases all non-template platforms probably start from where the template documentation left off.

My documentation is my own, but you are welcome to fork and modify these configurations.  Just be sure you understand what my scripts are doing before executing them to avoid problems.

Due to limited flexibility of the software or command line tools available in OS X and Windows, I may document how I configure them only for reference, as automation is not feasibly acheivable.
