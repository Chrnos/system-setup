# System Setup
#### Updated 10-15-2013

I use virtualization extensively.  For me it solves most of my computer woes while granting me greater flexibility both long and short term.  Learning how to use virtual machines has also dramatically improved my linux foo.

The one problem I have is due to the massive amount of testing I run through, I have to reconfigure many machines over and over again.  I am very picky about minimalist configurations, so this repository is to help expedite (and in the future automate) reinstallation!


## Instructions

I am a debian guy, it is what I know best, so while I may slowly add other platforms, there is a reason why everything here is debian based first.

All systems documented will be based off a template, the template system is the basic core I start with, a "default" debian state so to speak.

**Warning:  All documentation provided is "made-to-order", these are my machines and my preferences, they may not be yours so use them carefully.**

The documentation for OS X and Windows configuration likely cannot be scripted, so while they are included here for personal reference, they are technically not a direct component of the core of this project.


## Planned Features

Eventually I want an entire top-down scripted process that can execute with minor changes to a configuration file and automate the setup processes described in my documentation files.

Additionally I hope to someday produce a custom live install media, with a copy of the same setup script readily configured, or with USB ready to "be" configured on the fly.
