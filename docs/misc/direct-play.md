# direct play

This is a windows specific feature, part of the DirectX libs (I think), and used by many games.

Windows 8.1 Enterprise introduced a wonderful BSoD bug if you try to run games depending on it without enabling "Legacy Features".  Apparently things still in use today are not only legacy, but must be expressly allowed to avoid **permanently** crashing your system.  Good job windows...

Apparently DirectPlay is a legacy feature that must be turned on for older directx libraries to work.

More importantly, if you do not turn it on but run a DirectX installer your system may encounter an unrecoverable BSoD with error code `0x000021a`.
