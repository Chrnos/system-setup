# dpi

This is not an OS specific concept, but how each OS handles it is important.

## osx

One of the smarter OS's with DPI and has been applying specific customizations since they released the iPhone.  These same customizations to DPI are how Retina displays don't make everything super tiny.


## linux

_I have not experienced any dpi related settings or situations yet with linux, and cannot speak towards it._


## windows

Windows has had DPI settings even back in XP, but it has not attempted to automate them ever.

The setting worked great, by rendering things at larger scale.  This is what made it possible to use an HDTV properly.

Unfortunately Windows 8.1 mucked that all up by trying to be smarter than the user and failing to listen to the settings erratically leading to random scaling at boot time.
