# fortune summoners

I grabbed this game off of steam, and enjoy it greatly.  I want to document some problems and solutions, all related to running the game on Windows 8.


### slow in full screen

Sadly, something was removed or broken with Windows 8 that causes fullscreen mode for this game to crap out, in spite of working just fine with Windows 7.

The only work around I have found so far is to run it in windowed mode.


### small window

Sadly, the game was never written to be resized in windowed mode, so you have an 640x480 game running inside of a 1920x1080 modern resolution, it's small and hard to see.

One solution is to check the compatibility box for "640x480" mode.  **This is a bad solution because it does not account for the title bar at the top, and clips off the bottom of the window.**

My recommended solution is to use the Accessibility Mode magnifier.  You can magnify the screen to 175~225% and the window becomes nearly full-screen without cutting off any important bits like your money or other characters health.


### controller is way too fast

I found that the controller bug can be fixed by going into the menu and adjusting the sensitivity.

After reducing it a bit I found that the controller suddenly works 100% flawlessly.
