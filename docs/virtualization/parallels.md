# Parallels Desktop Mods

To install parallels tools you will need to mount the iso with execution options:

    mount -o exec /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
    /media/cdrom/install

The install script must be executed with root permissions.

Parallels Desktop 8 broke when installing parallels tools, and the 3D driver never loaded.  To resolve this you have to modify the init file post install.

**As of Parallels Desktop 9 the install process is fixed, but the drivers will still fail to load and in most cases a GUI is unusable.  I have since given up on using this platform and use VirtualBox instead.**

Post-installation you may encounter a video problem if the `/etc/initd/prl-x11` script does not contain the correct insserv headers, but you can easily add them to the top and re-run the script before rebooting:
