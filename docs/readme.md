I pride myself on creating thorough, detailed documentation.  I generally aim to deliver content that even the unfamiliar can read and make sense of.

This set of documents contains all the notes I've amassed regarding system configuration, as well as automation, and ties closely with the [setup scripts](../scripts/) at the upper level, and the configuration files in the [data](../data/) folder.

My current situations require configuration for:

- [windows multimedia, gaming, and development](windows.md)
- [osx development](osx.md)
- [linux development](linux/dev.md)
- [linux web server](linux/web.md)

I favor the debian distribution of linux, so all of my documentation and automation scripts are tailored for that platform.  _If you are using a rhel based platform, most of the automation tools will not work, but you will likely be able to follow the installation and configuration of many services._

I have a whole bunch of additional documents inside sub-folders that cater towards optional or very specific functionality for each platform.
