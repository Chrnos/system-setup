Fedora is based on RedHat linux, and uses the RPM package system.

My experience with Fedora, and RHEL based systems in general, has been very limited due to a lack of necessity.  I will have significantly less documentation to contribute and it may not be updated quite as often.

That said, my time using Fedora was filled with positive experiences with regards to the interface and how well its packages worked.  It's choice of default tools makes it significantly less intuitive for me to manage.  If they had sensible networking and didn't use systemd I'd probably use it as my primary OS.

Fedora easily boasts the greatest hardware compatibility, with regards to it working on older and newer laptops, even macbooks.  It's installer is excellently written as of 19.
