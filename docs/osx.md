This document is an aid to follow when configuring a fresh copy of OSX for development.


## during installation

**Do not:**

- use a Case Sensative HFS+
- encrypt your drive with File Vault

Case Sensative HFS+ partitions break loads of software and is an unnecessary change.

Using File Vault prior to downloading the latest updates after installing can lead to having to unencrypt, update, then re-encrypt the drive, which is a huge time sink.

**Which leads us to the first post-install step:**

- check for updates.


## firewall

The latest updates to the firewall have made it such that any application which updates may need to be approved again when launched.

Adding an additional desktop to Mission Control and setting the battery to display its percentage are also advisable changes.


## spotlight cache

If you end up with a problem with spotlight you can clear it's cache from command line.


##### commands

_Run this to clear all cache and rebuild (rebuilding can take quite a while):_

    sudo mdutil -E /


## custom fonts

- [ForMateKonaVe](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hetima/20061102/1162435711)
- [EPSON Kyoukashoutai](http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Japanese.html)

The EPSON font has been uploaded with skewed ASCII conversion, so while the font will work, its name is nearly impossible to type.  I recommend running it through a font editor simply to adjust the name to something sensible.

_The links for these fonts are externally hosted and may no-longer be valid, and I have decided to include a copy of each in this repository._

Installing fonts can be done by opening them and clicking the install button, or you can install them locally into `~/Library/Fonts/`, or globally `/Library/Fonts`.


## disable dashboard

I think the dashboard is a waste of space and resources and elect to disable it.  Applications load fast enough on SSD's that micro-applications are not nearly as useful as they may have been years back.


##### commands

_To stop the dashboard from starting by default:_

    defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES
    killall Dock


## finder settings

Open the finder settings menu with "command + j".  _The desktop has a separate menu, so be sure you have opened a finder window and that it is in focus before using the hotkey._

I generally check the box to force `List View` as the default.  I also check the calculate size option, because it makes checking folder and file sizes fast and easy.

In newer versions of OSX there is a checkbox to **display the `~/Library` folder**, which saves us an extra step we previously had to do via command line.

**Be sure you select "Use as Defaults" at the bottom or it won't take globally.**  Afterwards you'll want to remove saved view settings (the `.DS_Store` hidden files) recursively and globally to ensure the new settings take and are not overwritten locally per directory.


##### commands

_Run this to remove saved view settings and reload finder:_

    sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;
    killall Finder

_To fix the hidden `~/Library` via terminal, run this:_

    chflags nohidden ~/Library


## set hostname & domain name

You will want to set the machines host name, by default it will be your full name, which is often obnoxiously long for a network name.  You can set your hostname in `System Settings` under `Sharing`.  It can also be done via command line, but may not take affect globally until a reboot.

You can set your domain name via command line as well.


##### commands

_Run this command to set your hostname via terminal:_

    sudo scutil --set HostName mypc

_Full affects may not take place until rebooting._

_To set your domain name:_

    domainname example.loc


## configure terminal

I generally install and use [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home), but I also configure the default terminal just in case I need to use it.

I set the default color scheme to `Homebrew` with my choice of custom font (ForMateKonaVe) size 14.  I also go to the window tab and click the color & background button to set opacity to 40% with a 5% blur.


## app store

Here are some items I always grab from the App Store:

- [Dash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12)
- [Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12)
- [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

_Dash is a mac only software that costs money, but it is a worth-while purchase.  It gives you a complete comprehensive local copy of documentation for multiple languages.  This is awesome for travel purposes, or even just quick-checks on object types or method arguments.  I highly recommend it._

I would consider XCode optional.  If you do not plan to be developing for Mac using their specific libraries and Objective-C, then you probably don't need it.  _Also it cane take upwards of two hours to download on moderately fast internet connections._


## software

Here is a list of software I install:

- [Google Chrome Dev Channel](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel)
- [Google Hangouts Plugin](https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin)
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [RoboMongo](http://robomongo.org/)
- [Sequel Pro (aka Pancakes)](http://www.sequelpro.com/)
- [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/download/)
- [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html)
- [Adobe Flash Projector](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html)
- [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)

VirtualBox is a free Virtual Machine software with better linux guest support than leading commercial software such as Parallels and VMWare.  It is also cross platform, allowing you to create a virtual machine and transfer it anywhere with no major changes to interface or drivers.  _If you need 3D capabilities you will want to look at [Parallels Desktop]()._

In spite of the fact that flash is a dying industry, I often find myself in need of the ability to run an swf file, and the Flash Projector comes in a debug flavor, which makes it super easy to have a tiny executable that can run and test flash files without browser concerns.


## configuring installed software

### dash

Let's start with some basic configuration options.

To validate your purchased copy you may have to visit the `Purchase` tab and pick the appropriate option.

I use the HUD mode with `alt + space` as the hotkey to pull it up.  It starts with my system, and turn off its dock icon.  I show the menubar icon, but tell clicking to open the menu (not the application).

Here is a list of documentation I generally select (there are tons more):

- Bash
- Bootstrap 3
- C
- C++
- Cmake
- CSS
- Emmet
- GLib
- Go
- HTML
- Java EE7
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Man Pages
- Markdown
- Mongodb
- MySQL
- Nginx
- Node.js
- OpenGL 3
- OpenGL 4
- Python 2
- Python 3

The latest release also offers Cheat Sheets, which I also downloaded a few from:

- Git
- Git Flow
- HTML Entities
- Regular Expressions
- Sublime Text
- Tmux
- Vim

While I install a large number of docsets, I generally only enable the docsets related to the things I am working on.  So as I switch between projects I may tweek what docs are displayed when I search for things.

There are also many integration options for Dash.  For example you can configure it to run directly inside of tools like Sublime Text and XCode.

You will also want to register a quick-display hotkey.  I generally go with `alt+space`.


### the unarchiver

Preferred Settings:

- Select all archive formats for affiliation
- Select to always extract to the same folder as the archive is
- Create a new folder if there is more than one top-level item
- Move the archive to the trash after extraction
- Under advanced set automatic detection confidence level to 100%


### iterm2

Open the configuration and go to "Profiles" > "Text", then change the font settings (for regular font):

- Size 14 Font
- ForMateKonaVE Font Family

Next select "Profiles" > "Terminal" and click the checkbox for "Unlimited scrollback".

Now go to "Profiles" > "Keys" and add these key combinations:

- alt + delete: HEX 0x17
- alt + left arrow: escape sequence + b
- alt + right arrow: escape sequence + f

This will allow you to use alt to jump between words while in iTerm2 (eg delete whole word, go back a word, go forward a word).

Finally, import the [`Solarized High Contrast Dark`](https://github.com/mariozaizar/dotfiles/blob/master/themes/iTerm2/Solarized%20High%20Contrast%20Dark.itermcolors) color scheme from the GUI.

_Color schemes in iterm are loaded into a plist file and so doing so from command line is not as easy.  I may document the process in the future if I ever have time._


### virtualbox

VirtualBox offers USB 2.0 support, but you have to download and install the [Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

I also recommend creating a Host-Only network with a predictable IP range, which you can then specify static ip's in your virtual machines.

_Unfortunately VirtualBox caters towards the enterprise crowd and focuses on security at the cost of convenience and usability.  There is no "Shared Adapter" that allows virtual machines to have both internet access and local access, due to a built-in firewall on their NAT.  To gain local access you need a second host-only network device._


### transmission

Transmission is among my favorite software list now.  They provide a client and command line controls, for unix & linux platforms.  So far they have the best customizability, greatest cross platform support (minus windows) and most sensible configuration I've seen for what could operate as a torrent server software.

In the settings under "General" I tell it not to prompt when removing a torrent.  I also tell it to display the speeds in the "Badge" (viewed when alt + tabbing).

Under the "Transfers" tab I tell it to autoload `.torrent` files from `~/Downloads` and to save finished files there.  I tell it to keep the `.torrent` files inside `~/Downloads/.torrent/` and to keep partial downloads in `~/Downloads/.torrent/downloading/` and to append `.part` to the file names.  I tell it **not** to display confirmation when loading a torrent.

I setup a schedule under the "Bandwidth" tab to accomodate my access times.

Finally under the "Peers" tab I tell it to prefer encrypted peers **and** ignore unencrypted peers.  _This is a weak stop-gap against torrent scanners._


## [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

OSX lacks a package manager to install additional software without going to the web like you would on Windows.  Fortuntely, because it runs UNIX it is capable of supporting a package manager, and a few have come into being.

I favor homebrew for its user-local approach, which generally does not require sudo operations.  The [macports](http://www.macports.org/) alternative has more packages but tends to **"sudo-all-the-things"**.

_A newer package manager has recently come into being called [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), which works on linux as well as osx.  It does not have great traction on OSX yet, but may be worth checking out in the future._

**Homebrew depends on Command Line Tools, but this should automatically prompt to install on newer versions of OSX.**

For a well-rounded terminal experience with plenty of options, these are the packages I install:

- wget
- tmux
- openssl
- git
- git-flow
- mercurial
- svn
- bzr
- go
- youtube-dl
- awscli
- swftools
- vim
- weechat
- sshfs
- ffmpeg
- sfml
- sdl2
- graphicsmagick

Some of these packages have special flags for installation.  They should automatically install dependencies, but depending on the package there may be more to it than that.

To check package information prior to installing, you can use `brew info`.

_The first time you attempt to use `sshfs` you will get a warning popup notifying you of an untrusted kext.  The software will still work, but you need to permit it once._


##### commands

_Let's start by adding this line (with your own token) to your dot-files such as `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to bypass github API traffic limits:_

    export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=YOURTOKEN

_If you are using my [dot-files repository](https://github.com/cdelorme/dot-files/), the install script accepts your github username and password, and will auto-detect that you are using OS X and get you a fresh token on install._

_This will install homebrew and my list of packages:_

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
    brew doctor
    brew tap homebrew/versions
    brew update
    brew install wget
    brew install tmux
    brew install openssl
    brew install --with-gettext --with-pcre git
    brew install git-flow
    brew install mercurial
    brew install bzr
    brew install --with-python svn
    brew install --cross-compile-all go
    brew install --with-rtmpdump youtube-dl
    brew install awscli
    brew install --with-fftw --with-jpeg --with-giflib --with-lame --with-xpdf swftools
    brew install --with-lua --with-python3 --override-system-vi vim
    brew install --with-aspell --with-lua --with-python --with-guile --with-perl weechat
    brew install sshfs
    brew install --with-tools ffmpeg
    brew install sfml
    brew install --static glfw3
    brew install sdl2
    brew install --with-ghostscript --with-libtiff --with-jasper --with-libwmf --with-little-cms2 --with-perl graphicsmagick
    sudo /bin/cp -RfX /usr/local/opt/osxfuse/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs /Library/Filesystems/
    sudo chmod +s /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs
    aws configure
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    sudo youtube-dl -U

_I recommend creating a file at `/usr/local/bin/brewgrade` with these lines:_

    #!/bin/bash
    brew clean
    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew doctor

_Then adding a command to a crontab to automate running it:_

    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/brewgrade
    echo "@daily /usr/local/bin/brewgrade" >> ~/.crontab
    crontab ~/.crontab

_OSX effectively stopped supporting crontab and is pushing towards its own ctl-style configs with 20+ lines of XML instead of a single line to run a scheduled operation.  As a result it won't let you easily modify the crontab; thus far my experience shows that if you want to change the file you will have to edit it manually with `vim` (or any editor), then reload the file via `crontab ~/.crontab`.  If you attempt to use `crontab -e` it will not save changes or throw errors to indicate why._


## dot-files

**Next I recommend using my [dot-files repository](https://github.com/cdelorme/dot-files/) to enhance your prompt, vim configuration, and set a bunch of useful configuration defaults.**

Creating a set of useful dot-files is essential to enhancing your command line situation, but not everyone will find all of my settings to be useful.


### path modifications

Many of the packages you install with homebrew will already exist on the machine.  When you run a command it checks the paths in the order they appear in the PATH variable and stops as soon as it finds the command.  To use the new versions of same-named commands you have to change the `PATH` global variable to include the local bin first.  Be sure to add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$HOME/bin:$PATH

_This is one of the many modifications that is handled by my dot-files automatically._


### ssh key generation

It is recommended that you generate an ssh key, which can be used for ssh tunneling, numerous encryption services, and version control software.

**OS X should automatically remember and reload any keys you have added at reboot.**


##### commands

_Create SSH key and add to ssh-agent:_

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<youremail>"
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

_You will have to follow prompts when creating the key, and your email is an optional flag._



### git configuration

I usually set a number of defaults in my `~/.gitconfig`:

- username
- email
- editor
- auto-correction
- color ui
- push auto-match branch
- several aliases

The `~/.githelpers` file was written by [Gary Bernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/.githelpers), and is also included with my dot-files repo.

I generally create a `~/git/` folder to store my projects.

I highly recommend [Ralph Bean's Awesome Git Flow Tutorial](http://threebean.org/presentations/gitflow/#/step-1) and the [Git Bash Completion](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) script (included with my `dot-files`).


##### commands

_Run these and optionally fill in the blanks:_

    git config --global user.name "<yourname>"
    git config --global user.email "<youremail>"
    git config --global core.editor "vim"
    git config --global help.autocorrect 1
    git config --global color.ui true
    git config --global push.default matching
    git config --global alias.a add
    git config --global alias.s 'status -suall'
    git config --global alias.c commit
    git config --global alias.st stash
    git config --global alias.sa 'stash apply'
    git config --global alias.l '!. ~/.githelpers && pretty_git_log'
    git config --global alias.pp '!git pull && git push'


### activate bash-completion

Even after installing it with homebrew, you may have to add a symlink for it to be loaded.  Additionally you may need to load it from command line by running that symlink.


##### commands

_Run this to create the symlink:_

    ln -s "/usr/local/Library/Contributions/brew_bash_completion.sh" "/usr/local/etc/bash_completion"

_Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:_

    if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
      . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
    fi

_This is another configuration that I include in my dot-files repository._


### [sublime text](https://github.com/cdelorme/system-setup/tree/master/shared_config/sublime_text.md)

Since installing and configuring sublime text is nearly identical between platforms I've moved its instructions to a more centralized location.  Click the header link to read it!


## markdown quicklook

I install this so I can easily preview markdown files, the [repository is here](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown), but you can [download a prebuilt file here](http://jamesmoss.co.uk/blog/support-for-markdown-in-osx-quicklook/) and toss them into `/Library/QuickLook`.

With this package you can use the space-bar like with images and pdf files, and it will display HTML rendered preview of a markdown file.


## conclusion

Thus concludes my comprehensive OS X 10.9 setup and configuration process.

Despite my preferences and installed packages here, a majority of the work I do is done through virtual machines.  If you found this in any way useful, I highly recommend you visit my debian/linux documentation.
