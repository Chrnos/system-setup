I generally install two additional fonts to any machine I setup.  One for textbook japanese characters and the other is a monospaced font with japanese character support, which in general is just really clean for coding.  The original sources were here, but they may no longer be hosted:

- [ForMateKonaVe](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hetima/20061102/1162435711)
- [EPSON Kyoukashoutai](http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Japanese.html)

_I did have to modify the EPSON Kyoukashoutai font, because the file was uploaded with the wrong encoding which made the name illegible when attempting to install and use it._

To avoid problems with either host going down, or needing to modify fonts during the install, I include a copy of them:

- [ForMateKonaVe](../data/usr/share/fonts/truetype/jis/ForMateKonaVe.ttf)
- [EPSON Kyoukashoutai](../data/usr/share/fonts/truetype/jis/epkyouka.ttf)
