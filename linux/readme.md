# linux

While a majority of my knowledge centers around [debian](debian/), there are many distributions and some of what I know is a bit wider reaching.

I have installed and used these distributions for periods greater than 3 months:

- [arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)
- [ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
- [fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
- [centos](https://www.centos.org/)

I have also tried roughly a dozen alternative distributions, but usually not long enough to make an assessment.

If I had more time, I would be inclined to try arch again, only because I found it to be a fantastic experience that trumped even debian.  However at the time bad RAM led to instability and a fresh install, and I wanted a system that more closely matched the servers I was writing code for at the time.  _Having switched to a compiled-code preference (golang), I bet I would be very happy with arch._
