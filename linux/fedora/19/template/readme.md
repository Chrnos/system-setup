# Fedora Template

Over the summer (2013) I had a chance to play around in Fedora for a while, and found the OS to be fairly solid.

It doesn't have anything specific that stands out about it by comparison to other distro's, except perhaps its strict use of only free and open source software.

I documented the setup process for creating a matching template system to my debian template, but it may not be as polished as I am less familiar with the platforms tools.
