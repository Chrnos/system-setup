#### Updated 11-20-2013

I use IPFire as a Proxy Cache Router Firewall WAP machine, and I do so from a virtualized environment, supplied with a mPCI wireless card.

It does all of these roles excellently, with great driver support.

It is a debian based distribution, unlike most others which are BSD based.

I used to use [pfsense](http://www.pfsense.org/), but they (to my knowledge) still have terrible wireless support, which is important to me.

Using ipfire in this context I can create an entirely self-contained network of both virtual and real machines, without any additional devices.

A good portion of the configuration is personal preference, so what I choose to supply here will primarily be for my own reference.

Also, almost none of it is done through command line, because it has a web interface and that is the only approach I am familiar with as far as ipfire service configuration goes.
