# transmission

The `transmission-daemon` package is fantastic and I highly recommend it in contrast to most who suggest `rtorrent`.  In my experience transmission is cleaner, easier to configure, and has far better interface options for modern software.

My suggested base configuration can be found [here](../data/extras/etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json).  _Anytime you want to change the configuration you must stop the transmission service first, since it writes the current configuration on exist which will delete any changes you make beforehand._

File ownership is one thing you'll need to correct by adding yourself to the same group as the default created by transmission during installation:

	# add user to group
	usermod -aG debian-transmission username


## quirks

In my opinion there are two quirks I have found with transmission while attempting to run it as a server service.

- file ownership can lead to unexpected behavior
- lack of post-processing behavior is as debilitating as `rtorrent`

While you can give transmission a `watchDir`, it will be unable to read files with your own group applied.  _Using sticky-bits can address this, but you still have to manually drop files there then yourself, **and moving files will in fact evade sticky-bits and those files will never get loaded, so you have to cp the files and delete the originals.**_

The second problem is that there is a lack of states that trigger scripted events.  Primarily there is a state when the download has completed, but not when you have hit your desired seeding ratio.

To address both of these problems I craft a [go-transmission-helper](https://github.com/cdelorme/go-transmission-api), which can be compiled and run in your crontab from the same machine to automatically torrent files from a path of your choosing, and to automatically clear torrents in a true finished state.

_It may be equally possible to run `transmission-daemon` in userspace with a custom `systemctl` unit file, but I have not spent the time to verify the setup._


## ownership

If you wish to run the service as a specific user, you can modify the systemd unit file located at `/lib/systemd/system/transmission-daemon.service` and set another user.

You will need to run `systemctl daemon-reload`, then `systemctl restart transmission-daemon.service`.

This will automatically generate a `~/.config/transmission-daemon/` folder with `settings.json` and the former `/var/lib/transmission-daemon/.config/` metadata now under your users ownership.

Remember to stop `transmission-daemon` before modifying the settings.json, or using `kill -HUP ` to ask transmission to reload the settings.json instead.


## iptables

While you may find dynamic port mapping works well enough, I prefer fixed ports.

Here is how to open the default peer traffic port:

	# tranmission peer traffic (default port 51413)
	-A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 51413 -j ACCEPT

For the web interface here is how you can lock it down to the current machine:

	# transmission web interface restricted-local-access
	-A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9091 -j ACCEPT

_You could also use a local address and subnet mask to allow anyone on the same private network to access (eg. `192.168.0.0/24`)._


## optimizations

You may encounter messages in your logs suggesting an increase to receive and send buffer sizes.  Those messages relate to handling connection metadata and these changes can help alleviate the errors while boosting performance:

	echo 'net.core.rmem_max = 16777216' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
	echo 'net.core.wmem_max = 4194304' >> /etc/sysctl.conf

_For these changes to take effect the `transmission-daemon` must be restarted._
