This is the current stable debian release, and is the one I am using.  Documentation inside here is intended for use in this release and may not work with other versions, or be at all accurate.

Here is the list of documentation I am actively maintaining:

- [Template](template.md)
- [Web](web.md)
- [Communications](comm.md)
- [Xen](xen.md)
- [IPFire](ipfire.md)
