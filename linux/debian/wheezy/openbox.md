# Debian Wheezy OpenBox UI
#### Updated 2014-3-18

Tentative instructions for creating a [crunchbang-like](http://crunchbang.org/) debian install, with many preference based changes.

**This is still a work in progress!**

Packages in addition to (or alternative to) raspberry pi's listings:

- openbox-themes
- conky-all (instead of **just** conky)

It is also quite likely that I can re-use most of the instructional steps from the raspberry pi (and inversely patch them with whatever changes I have tested here).


compare gmrun to kupfer

List of tasks:


Remaining Openbox Tasks:

- volume control research

volume reference (in case xfce4 is not enough): https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=73020
another volume reference: http://urukrama.wordpress.com/2007/12/19/managing-sound-volumes-in-openbox/
seems xfce4 was a mistake, what I need is openbox volume hotkeys AND the volumetray-alsa package: http://softwarebakery.com/maato/volumeicon.html

Remove the items from this list, then get to work with the volumeicon package:

    Get: 1 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy/main libxfce4util-common all 4.8.2-1 [95.3 kB]
    Get: 2 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy/main libxfce4util4 amd64 4.8.2-1 [75.7 kB]
    Get: 3 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy/main libxfce4util-bin amd64 4.8.2-1 [50.7 kB]
    Get: 4 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy/main xfconf amd64 4.8.1-1 [155 kB]
    Get: 5 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy/main libxfconf-0-2 amd64 4.8.1-1 [79.0 kB]
    Get: 6 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy/main xfce4-volumed amd64 0.1.13-3 [15.6 kB]

Cool [slim info](http://slim.berlios.de/manual.php), username as halt, reboot, or exit and root password will execute the desired operation!  No extra buttons necessary.

- volume control research (see above notes)
- openbox theme (custom colors & design)
    - rc.xml config
    - menu.xml config
- pcmanfm configuration & theme to match openbox
- urxvt configuration & theme to match openbox
- tint2 configuration & theme to match openbox
- slim config (if necessary, bg perhaps?)
- conky slim-bar config for raspberry pi (low-profile lightweight conky config, easier on resources)
- conky add hotkeys to list & theme to match openbox
- conky lua enhancement for radius edges of bg script
- conky radial lua script (for kickass high-end display multi-core systems!)
- investigate multiple keyboard layouts (mapped per keyboard id)
- lightson daemon script to keep the xscreensaver from doing things while certain progs are running

investigate pipelight for debian to play netflix?


I should probably also add this to my gui.md packages:

- flashplugin-nonfree



Install all xorg video drivers:

    aptitude install -r xserver-xorg-video-all


We will need to add users to all of these groups now:

- fuse
- scanner
- bluetooth
- netdev
- audio
- video
- adm

Apparently this can be done via a **single** command line:

    usermod -aG adm,audio,video,fuse,scanner,netdev,bluetooth cdelorme





# Massive Reverse Engineered Package List

I am still working through all of these, and a lot of them won't "make the cut", but the task itself is pending.

Window System (Required for basically any window manager platform):

- xorg


Screen Manager:

- arandr (gui frontend for xrandr which comes with xorg)


Window Manager:

- openbox (Window Manager)
    - obconf (gui to edit entire ob theme)
    - obmenu (gui alternative to editing menu.xml)

_The gui editors are optional installs, as everything can be done via the configuration scripts._


Taskbar:

- tint2 (lightweight taskbar)


System Monitor:

- conky (sweet lightweight, and heavily customizable)


Application Launcher:

- gmrun (launch from desktop via ctrl+enter then type/auto-complete)


Screensaver:

- xscreensaver


Laptop Power Management Features:

- xfce4-power-manager


Terminal:

- rxvt-unicode (light & powerful)
    - yeahconsole (to popup the terminal like guake)
- terminator (heavy-weight alternative)


Clipboard Manager:

- clipit (lightweight)


Keyboard Switcher (probably desirable?):

- fbxkb (X11 keyboard indicator/switcher)


Wallpaper Software:

- feh (lightweight /w full cli, but also a previewer etc)
- nitrogen (heavy-weight gui desktop switcher)

_With `feh`, as a command line tool, it is possible to easily swap wallpaper on a timer, such as using a anacrontab to randomly pick a background image in a folder.  It should also be easy to add a right click command to set a desktop background when picking images._


Theme Switcher:

- lxappearance (theme switcher for gtk+, has problems, theme name is a simple config changes via text)

_Theme selection is also technically offered through obconf, although that may be for openbox, while gtk+ themes are for any other application that may be run on my desktop._



Notification Daemon:

- xfce4-notifyd (simple, visually appealing)


File Search:

- catfish (supports many engines)


Sudo Prompt:

- gksu (preferred)

    - thunar-archive-plugin
    - thunar-dropbox-plugin
    - thunar-media-tags-plugin


GUI Audio Controls:

- xfce4-volumed (volume hotkeys?)


Image Viewing Software:
