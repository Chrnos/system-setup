# Debian Wheezy OpenBox UI
#### Updated 2014-6-14

Tentative instructions for creating a [crunchbang-like](http://crunchbang.org/) debian install, with many preference based changes.

**This is still a work in progress!**

Packages in addition to (or alternative to) raspberry pi's listings:


It is also quite likely that I can re-use most of the instructional steps from the raspberry pi (and inversely patch them with whatever changes I have tested here).

## configuring & theming conky

We want four different types of configurations:

- logs
- skinny
- command
- radial


The `logs` configuration simply makes log output immediately accessible by printing them onto the background of the system.  It requires that the user has read access to the log files, which can be accomplished by adding them to the `adm` group.  Here is my configuration:

    ADD CONFIG HERE

The `skinny` is a low-profile status menu that sits at the bottom (or top) of the screen, which includes a limited subset of information about the system state.  The idea is to provide just enough information about the system without eating vast amounts of resources.  To achieve this its configuration has a slower heartbeat.  Here is my configuration:

    ADD CONFIG HERE

The `command` config is a higher profile configuration which includes more detailed information and a section for common system hotkeys (mostly custom built).  It has a faster heartbeat, and more detailed information than the `skinny` configuration, including a process list of the top commands eating resources on the system.  Here is my configuration:

    ADD CONFIG HERE

The "final boss" configuration is the `radial` config, which takes full advantage of lua to build a detailed and responsive "drivers view" of the systems cpu and memory consumption.  It is ideal for multi-processor systems, and has a slightly prettier layout than `command`.  Here is my configuration:

    ADD CONFIG HERE


Supplemental systems include the following:

- lua transparent bg (helpful for ARM systems like rpi)
- radial system (used with the radial config)

**It is important to understand that these configurations can be run alongside eachother, as individual conky instances.  This is how both logs and command systems work.**

Found this on the web, may tailor to my liking:

    # these three lines enable clicking on links to open them ;)

## configuring & theming slim



### using slim

To shutdown the system enter `halt` as the username followed by the root password.  Similarly to reboot the system use `reboot` as the username.



## configuring & theming openbox

Files of importance:

- rc.xml config
- menu.xml config


## configuring pcmanfm



## lightson daemon


- investigate multiple keyboard layouts (mapped per keyboard id)
- lightson daemon script to keep the xscreensaver from doing things while certain progs are running



## multiple keyboard layout configuration

This depends on `xorg` currently, but I have a lot of details to work out still.



## pipelight

For linux this is the alternative to netflix.  You can run a browser in linux while it connects silverlight plugin through a wine bottle.

_Details pending._



## viewnior

Because most other software absolutely sucks, I want to get the best possible high performance low profile image viewer available, and viewnior is exactly that.

_Still looking into the build process, as it depends on too many newer things._


## gui volume controls with pulse and alsa

- volumeicon-alsa

Add user to the `pulse-access` group, in order to access and modify volume state.

Preferred volume config:

    [StatusIcon]
    stepsize=3
    lmb_slider=false
    mmb_mute=false
    use_horizontal_slider=true
    show_sound_level=true
    onclick=urxvt -e 'alsamixer'
    theme=Default

    [Hotkeys]
    up_enabled=true
    down_enabled=true
    mute_enabled=true
    up=XF86AudioRaiseVolume
    down=XF86AudioLowerVolume
    mute=XF86AudioMute

    [Alsa]
    card=default

**The volumeicon package is technically not necessary, as the hotkeys to run the amixer commands can be done entirely from the openbox configuration.**

_I am still working on updating the hotkeys, since `XF86` doesn't really exist on my keyboards._

## Tools to Compare & Investigate


A potential `rxvt-unicode` enhancer:

- yeahconsole

It may be possible yet to get urxvt to popup without `yeahconsole`, so I'm going to investigate it further still.  If I fail to acheive my goal I will install and test `yeahconsole`.
