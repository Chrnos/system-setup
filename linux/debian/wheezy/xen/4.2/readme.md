# Xen 4.2 Server ReadMe
#### Updated 10-14-2013

The documentation attached was created through nine months of trial and error, and is by no means a "final copy" that should be used.  It is a working install, but the newest release 4.3 has already come out and this documentation may not be updated with changes going forward.

**Use at your own risk.**

The intentions of this documentation are to create a complete Xen server with working VGA Passthrough in roughly 2 hours if simply following the directions.

A slightly dated set of accompanying videos can be found on my [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC70DC33D993CEB44).
