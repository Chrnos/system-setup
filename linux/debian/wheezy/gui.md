# Debian Wheezy GUI Documentation
#### Updated 2014-6-14

This is my desktop development configuration documentation, and continues where my template documention left off.


## Hardware

My template can run on 512MB of RAM, but for the GUI environment you will need at least 800MB, preferably 1GB or more if you want to use that environment.


## Troubleshooting

A graphics card will be required, though driver installation varies wildly and won't be covered here.  If you install the packages below and cannot run startx or telinit 3 into the gdm3 GUI, then you may have to look elsewhere for future guides.


## Configuration

This document discusses some generic tools and is not tied to any interface in particular.  It is a set of recommendations, not required to run a user interface.

Let's start with a set of generic tools and services:

    aptitude install -ryq gparted vlc gtk-recordmydesktop chromium transmission transmission-cli openshot flashplugin-nonfree lame ffmpeg shared-mime-info fontconfig fontconfig-config fonts-droid fonts-droid fonts-freefont fonts-liberation fonts-takao ttf-mscorefonts-installer weechat weechat-curses gimp gimp-plugin-registry evince

For development I also recommend these packages:

    aptitude install -ryq bpython libguichan-dev libX11-dev libmcrypt-dev python-dev python3-dev python-pygame libperl-dev openjdk-6-jre


## user configuration

For full privileges users should belong to these groups:

- fuse (drive mounting)
- scanner
- bluetooth
- netdev (networking conf)
- audio
- video
- adm (logs)

##### commands

_This can be done via a **single** command line:_

    usermod -aG adm,audio,video,fuse,scanner,netdev,bluetooth username


## Other Recommended Software


### Sublime Text

_These instructions vary slightly depending on whether you are using Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3, though 3 is in beta it offers many improvements over the second version, and is moderately stable._

Let's start by downloading the latest copy off their website.

Grab the latest version off their website:

    # Download Sublime Text 3
    wget -O ~/sublime.tar.bz2 http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/sublime_text_3_build_3059_x64.tar.bz2
    tar xf sublime.tar.bz2
    rm sublime.tar.bz2

    # Download Sublime Text 2
    wget -O ~/sublime.tar.bz2 http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2%20x64.tar.bz2
    tar xf sublime.tar.bz2
    rm sublime.tar.bz2

You have a choice with sublime, you can install a system local copy, but I recommend a local copy per user to avoid version concerns.  It will create a settings folder per user automatically.

To install globally:

    mkdir /usr/local/applications
    mv Sublime* /usr/local/applications/sublime_text/
    ln -s /usr/bin/subl /usr/local/applications/sublime_text/sublime_text

To install locally:

    mkdir ~/applications
    mv Sublime* ~/applications/sublime_text/
    mkdir -p ~/bin
    ln -s ~/applications/sublime_text/sublime_text ~/bin/subl

_Copying with the asterisk may fail if there are multiple items that start with the first word._

I recommend these packages for the editor:

- [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/)
- [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview)
- [SublimeCodeIntel](https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel)
- [Origami](https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami)

My sublime text configuration appears as:

    {
        "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
        "caret_style": "phase",
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Sunburst.tmTheme",
        "font_face": "ForMateKonaVe",
        "font_size": 16.5,
        "highlight_line": true,
        "highlight_modified_tabs": true,
        "match_brackets_angle": true,
        "scroll_past_end": true,
        "scroll_speed": 2.0,
        "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
        "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true
    }

_This does depend on the custom `ForMateKonaVe` font._

I add also modify the hotkeys for SublimeCodeIntel go-to-definition and Markdown Preview to build to browser:

    [
        { "keys": ["ctrl+enter"], "command": "goto_python_definition"},
        { "keys": ["ctrl+tab"], "command": "next_view" },
        { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+tab"], "command": "prev_view" },
        { "keys": ["alt+m"], "command": "markdown_preview", "args":
            { "target": "browser", "parser": "markdown" }
        }
    ]

I create a desktop launcher using `~/.local/share/applications/subl.desktop` containing:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Sublime Text
    Comment=The World's best text editor!
    TryExec=subl
    Exec=subl
    Icon=~/applications/sublime_text/Icon/256x256/sublime_text.png
    Type=Application
    Categories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;TerminalEmulator;Office;

_While this document is centric to debian, I feel it beneficial to share that fedora and ubuntu both work with the above configuration, however Arch does not read the PATH variable for the local `~/bin` folder, and does not expand the tilde into the home directory, requiring static paths._


## Google Chrome Dev Channel

I prefer the dev channel of google chrome.  The easy way to install it is to go to your current web browser, search "Google Chrome Dev Channel" and then download the `.deb` and install it with `sudo dpkg -i`.

It should ask to be set as the default browser at first launch.


##### Commands

_Register google's apt key:_

    wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -

_Create a file at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google` with these lines:_

    # Google Chrome repo http://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/
    deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main
    deb http://dl.google.com/linux/talkplugin/deb/ stable main
    deb http://dl.google.com/linux/earth/deb/ stable main
    deb http://dl.google.com/linux/musicmanager/deb/ stable main

_Run these commands to update aptitude:_

    sudo aptitude clean
    sudo aptitude update

_Install these packages:_

    sudo aptitude install -ryq google-chrome-stable google-chrome-unstable google-talkplugin

_Set as default browser:_

    update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/bin/google-chrome-unstable


## [Youtube Downloader](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)

This is a really cool command line utility that you can use to download (the highest quality) youtube videos without any GUI utilities.  It includes asynchronous processing and even spits out the percent status.


##### Commands

_Run these commands to download and install the `youtube-dl` command:_

    git clone https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl
    cd youtube-dl
    sudo python setup.py install
    cd ..
    rm -rf youtube-dl
