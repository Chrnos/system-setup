# debian
#### Updated 11-20-2013

This is my favorite linux distribution.  Oddly I don't care for ubuntu or mint, but I love debian.

It is an incredibly solid OS for just about any kind of stable server configuration, whether serving files, website content, database content, or just storing logs, it is hands down one of the best fully-featured systems with great support, documentation, a vast community, and near-infinite list of packages.

For years I used this distro exclusively, and even now I still use it extensively.  I expect that a larger portion of my documentation will be specifically for debian, though it can probably be easily migrated to other distros.

Currently I use [debian wheezy](wheezy/readme.md), the latest stable.
