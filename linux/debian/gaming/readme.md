# gaming on linux

Up until 2012 I had been using windows for gaming, but once I gave linux a shot I don't believe I will ever install windows again (I also refuse to purchase windows-exclusive games).

In the last few years linux has become quite a monster in the gaming realm, with [steam](steam.md) fully backing it, and thousands of developers producing ports or supporting it on release.

What doesn't have a native release or port, often times will run in [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [playonlinux](playonlinux.md).


## native

Here are some of the games I play with native linux releases:

- And Yet It Moves
- Bastion
- Borderlands 2
- [Cave Story (doukutsu)](http://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php)
- Dust: An Elysian Tail
- Dustforce
- FTL: Faster Than Light
- Guacamelee! Gold Edition
- Kerbel Space Program
- Portal
- Portal 2
- Strike Suit Zero
- Transistor

_For whatever reason, Strike Suit Zero Director's Cut is not a linux-native release._


## controllers

For controller support, the [xboxdrv](xboxdrv.md) is a very useful daemon.

If using wine or playonlinux then you may want to use [koku-xinput-wine](https://github.com/KoKuToru/koku-xinput-wine).


## emulators

There are an enormous variety of emulators, both I have a couple favorites:

- [mednafen](mednafen.md) for all older games
- [ppsspp](ppsspp.md) for psp

There are others like [pcsx2](pcsx2.md), but they are complex to compile, and have conflicting package installation dependencies.

I have also dabbled with the ragnarok online server emulator [rathena](rathena.md) with great success.
