This is an absolutely awesome PSP emulator with zero post-install configuration.

To be completely honest, it has the best UI/UX out of any modern software I have used on the desktop.  The controls are seemless and premapped intelligently, work with keyboard and controller, and is fully custom using opengl.


## installation

I recommend building it from the [latest source](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp).  If you need it to be entirely stable, you can checkout the appropriately tagged release.

_My experience has shown that the latest master can be finicky, so a tagged version is certainly safer._


## controllers

Controllers in ppsspp work for games, but may not work as expected in the interface.  There seems to be some disconnect with the work in that part of the system.
