#### Updated 11-20-2013

I only just began using arch, but can already tell it's exactly what I want in my Linux distro.

It's an extremely bare-bones "Do It Yourself" style OS.  It has earned the term "Hard Mode" in linux communities.

It's difficulty accelerates self-education and empowers users to both learn, and customize every aspect of their experience.

I expect to be using this platform a great deal more in the future.

_I do not believe arch is an alternative to debian, in fact they serve entirely different purposes.  I will still continue to use debian for any form of server infrastructure, but I will likely use arch in all future desktop environments._
